# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

keller2.wns.wilders.dev {
        # Set this path to your site's directory.
        root * ~/apps/production/2023-03-wns-keller-groupe2

        # Enable the static file server.
        file_server

        # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
        reverse_proxy localhost:3000

        log {
         output file /var/log/caddy/production.log
        }
        # Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
        # php_fastcgi localhost:9000
}
