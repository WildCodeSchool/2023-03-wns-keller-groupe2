## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

**env.sample**
The env.sample file provides a template for creating an environment configuration file. It contains a list of environment variables and their default values, which can be used as a starting point for creating a .env file.

The .env file is used to store sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and other configuration settings that should not be hard-coded in the application code. We recommend that you copy env.sample to .env and customize it with your own configuration settings.

**Recommended IDE Setup**

An IDE: Visual Studio Code is recommended for this project.

**Used:**

[ESLint]: ESLint is a popular open-source static code analysis tool for JavaScript code. It is designed to identify and report potential problems or issues in JavaScript code, as well as enforce consistent coding styles and best practices.

[TypeScript]: The goal of TypeScript is to improve the quality and maintainability of large-scale JavaScript applications. By adding features such as static data types, classes, interfaces, and stronger type checking, TypeScript helps catch errors earlier in the development process and improve code readability. TypeScript also facilitates interoperability between different JavaScript libraries and frameworks. Ultimately, TypeScript aims to make JavaScript programming more enjoyable and productive.

[Sass] https://sass-lang.com/: SASS, an acronym for "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets," is a powerful and popular extension of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). It introduces various features and enhancements to the standard CSS syntax, making it more efficient and easier to work with when creating styles for websites or applications.

[React]: React is a popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

[React Router]: React Router is a popular open-source routing solution for React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by React Training and a community of individual developers and companies.

[Create React App]: Create React App is a popular open-source framework for creating React applications. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
